# Breaking Changes
- CHANGED ToTracedDomainEvent{TEntity, TKey} extension method on the EfCoreTracedAggregateEntityExtensions class in the Savvyio.Extensions.EFCore.Domain.EventSourcing namespace to include an IMarshaller interface that is used when converting a traced domain event type into a deserialized version of ITracedDomainEvent
- CHANGED ToByteArray extension method on the TracedDomainEventExtensions class in the Savvyio.Extensions.EFCore.Domain.EventSourcing namespace to include an IMarshaller interface that is used when converting an ITracedDomainEvent into an array of bytes
 
# Improvements
- CHANGED EfCoreTracedAggregateEntity{TEntity, TKey} class in the Savvyio.Extensions.EFCore.Domain.EventSourcing namespace to include an IMarshaller interface in the constructor that is used when converting between ITracedDomainEvent into a serialized format
- CHANGED EfCoreTracedAggregateRepository{TEntity, TKey} class in the Savvyio.Extensions.EFCore.Domain.EventSourcing namespace to include an IMarshaller interface in the constructor that is used when converting between ITracedDomainEvent and arbitrary data
