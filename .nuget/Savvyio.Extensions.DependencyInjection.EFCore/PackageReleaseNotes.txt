# New Features
- ADDED DefaultEfCoreDataStore class in the Savvyio.Extensions.DependencyInjection.EFCore namespace that provides a default implementation of the IPersistentDataStore{T,TOptions,TMarker} interface to support multiple implementations that serves as an abstraction layer before the actual I/O communication with a source of data using Microsoft Entity Framework Core
- ADDED EfCoreDataSource class in the Savvyio.Extensions.DependencyInjection.EFCore namespace that provides a default implementation of the IEfCoreDataSource{TMarker} interface to support multiple implementations that does the actual I/O communication with a source of data using Microsoft Entity Framework Core
- ADDED EfCoreDataSourceOptions class in the Savvyio.Extensions.EFCore namespace that provides configuration options for IEfCoreDataStore{TMarker}
- ADDED EfCoreDbContext class in the Savvyio.Extensions.DependencyInjection.EFCore namespace that provides a default implementation of the DbContext class to support Savvy I/O extensions of Microsoft Entity Framework Core in multiple implementations
- ADDED EfCoreRepository class in the Savvyio.Extensions.DependencyInjection.EFCore namespace that provides a default implementation of the IPersistentRepository{TEntity,TKey,TMarker} interface to support multiple implementations that serves as an abstraction layer before the actual I/O communication towards a data store using Microsoft Entity Framework Core
- ADDED EfCoreServiceOptions class in the Savvyio.Extensions.DependencyInjection.EFCore namespace that provides configuration options for Microsoft Dependency Injection
- ADDED IEfCoreDataSource interface in the Savvyio.Extensions.DependencyInjection.EFCore namespace that defines a generic way to support multiple implementations that does the actual I/O communication towards a data store using Microsoft Entity Framework Core
- ADDED ServiceCollectionExtensions class in the Savvyio.Extensions.DependencyInjection.EFCore namespace that consist of extension methods for the IServiceCollection interface: AddEfCoreDataSource, AddEfCoreRepository, AddEfCoreDataStore, AddDefaultEfCoreDataStore
