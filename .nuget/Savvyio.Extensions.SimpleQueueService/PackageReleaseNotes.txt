# New Features
- EXTENDED AmazonMessageOptions class in the Savvyio.Extensions.SimpleQueueService namespace with a new read-only property, ClientConfigurations, that can be set using the ConfigureClient method
- ADDED ClientConfigExtensions class in the Savvyio.Extensions.SimpleQueueService namespace that consist of extension methods for the ClientConfig class: IsValid, SimpleQueueService and SimpleNotificationService
 
# Improvements
- CHANGED AmazonCommandQueue class in the Savvyio.Extensions.SimpleQueueService.Commands namespace to use the ClientConfigurations property when configured; otherwise the Endpoint property is used as it has previously (both properties are part of AmazonMessageOptions)
- CHANGED AmazonEventBus class in the Savvyio.Extensions.SimpleQueueService.EventDriven namespace to use the ClientConfigurations property when configured; otherwise the Endpoint property is used as it has previously (both properties are part of AmazonMessageOptions)
- CHANGED AmazonMessage{TRequest} class in the Savvyio.Extensions.SimpleQueueService namespace to use the ClientConfigurations property when configured; otherwise the Endpoint property is used as it has previously (both properties are part of AmazonMessageOptions)
- CHANGED AmazonCommandQueue class in the Savvyio.Extensions.SimpleQueueService.Commands namespace to store the full type name of the actual IMessage{T} implementation instead of the enclosing type of the payload data
- CHANGED AmazonEventBus class in the Savvyio.Extensions.SimpleQueueService.EventDriven namespace to store the full type name of the actual IMessage{T} implementation instead of the enclosing type of the payload data
- CHANGED AmazonMessage{TRequest} class in the Savvyio.Extensions.SimpleQueueService namespace to use the full type name of the actual IMessage{T} implementation instead of the enclosing type of the payload data glued together with MakeGenericType on IMessage{T}
